          Psalm 149:6 Our vision as a church is to work toward building the
          people of God on the foundation of the living word as commissioned by
          God
          <b><i> “go build my people”</i></b
          >.
          <br />
          We desire to liberate people by the high praises offered unto God,
          eventually bringing the people to a place of worship and intimacy in
          the secret place of the most high. Our utmost calling is to make
          people fall in love with Jesus, and to make them desire and love His
          presence above all, thus making worship a lifestyle, so that they will
          in turn go to the ends of the earth and make disciples out of
          overflowing love and gratitude for the Lord, fulfilling the great
          commission.
