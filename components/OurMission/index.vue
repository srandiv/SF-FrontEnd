        This church was birthed into being in 1987 with a little bible study
        group that met on Thursday afternoons in a home. The group grew in
        number and hunger when the Lord led us to start services on Sundays.
        Today there are around 450 members, and three branches that meet on
        Sundays with ministries for men, women, youth, teens and children.
        Regular bible studies are conducted weekly which are recorded and
        circulated among many hundreds of believers locally and abroad. All
        glory to God "Ebenezer" who has brought us thus far carrying us in His
        hands like little children. If not for His amazing grace we would not
        have been able to come this far.

        The land for the church was donated by a family, where a physical
        structure (temporary) was erected in 1990 with six pillars and a tin
        roof over us. This roof was never an obstacle for the presence of God
        that continually over shadowed every meeting. The permanent structure
        was completed in 1997 as God divinely and supernaturally provided every
        requirement. "BELIEVE IT" we started the structure with less than one
        fourth of the estimated cost with just prayer and total dependency on
        God, with no fund raising projects. God’s provisions continued to flow
        abundance financially, materially and hands that laboured in love until
        the building was completed. The Lord did not stop at that but provided
        us with sophisticated musical instruments, PA systems, multimedia
        projectors and skilful musicians gifted and talented manpower that has
        enabled us to launch this site to bless many of our own family of
        believers that are in countries like Italy, America, Australia and
        Canada.

        We experienced the “First Outpouring of the Holy Spirit” in 1996 that
        brought a revival and a cleansing of the church. During that season, the
        Lord gave us Isaiah 60-The promise of Glory. We held on to it
        faithfully. Thank God His wisdom is far greater, from a faithful stump
        that was left behind the Lord brought forth an army of worshippers. We,
        as generals created an atmosphere for the presence of God, and an
        open-heaven for God to work. The glory of God descended upon us
        exploding the atmosphere. People became hungry for God’s glory. We saw
        and experienced His awesome glory literally.
